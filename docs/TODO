- TEST system (done)

- generate UDF documentation

- add --udf-cflags switch to mysql_config 
  take care that debug settings and CFLAGS from
	environment are preserved

- configure/make stuff 
  - required headers
  - required libs
  - search pathes for libs and headers
  - custom make rules
  => can be mostly delegated to automake?

- mysql version specific stuff
 - no real version specific changes to the actual API up to 5.0
 - but some internal function names changed, e.g regcomp() became my_regcomp()

- support for constant parameters in init function

- finish datetime support (relies on non-public header files now)

- support for other pseudo-types: "mixed", "enum"(?), ...

- test for HAVE_DLOPEN in configure step

- debug configure option should be aware of -DDBUG_* in CFLAGS
