- TEST system (done)

- generate UDF documentation
 - use same DocBook semantics as PHP?

- add --udf-cflags switch to mysql_config 
  lets wait for whatever solution comes with the new PLUGIN stuff  

- configure/make stuff 
  - required headers
  - required libs
  - search pathes for libs and headers
  - custom make rules
  => can be mostly delegated to automake?

- mysql version specific stuff
 - no real version specific changes to the actual API up to 5.0
 - but some internal function names changed, e.g regcomp() became my_regcomp()

- support for constant parameters in init function

- finish datetime support (relies on non-public header files now)

- support for other pseudo-types: "mixed", "enum"(?), ...

- test for HAVE_DLOPEN in configure step
  -> not needed, this can be taken from the servers my_config.h

- debug configure option should be aware of -DDBUG_* in CFLAGS
  -> a new autoconf macro now checks whether the server that the
     UDF compiles against has debug enabled, no need to configure
     this on the UDF level itself

- DECIMAL parameters now supported?
