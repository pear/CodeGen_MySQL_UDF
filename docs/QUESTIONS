Q: What if a udf functions name is supposed to mimic a C library function name?
A: Make creative use of caps as UDF names are case insensitive
   e.g. when exporting foobar as UDF foobar you can call the C function FooBar
   or FOOBAR

Q: How does Oracle do this? They have a SQL syntax to import plain C library
   functions right away without wrapper code but i forgot how to do it ...

A: It looks like this:
  
    CREATE FUNCTION get_val ( x_val IN NUMBER, y_val IN NUMBER, image IN LONG RAW ) 
      RETURN BINARY_INTEGER 
      AS LANGUAGE C NAME "c_get_val" LIBRARY c_utils PARAMETERS (...); 

   Details should be in "Oracle8i Application Developers Guide - Fundamentals"
